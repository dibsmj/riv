          India is promoting sustainable fashion by focusing on eco-friendly
          materials like organic cotton, handloom textiles, and recycled
          fabrics. The government supports green initiatives, while brands are
          adopting ethical practices and certifications like GOTS and Fair
          Trade. Consumer awareness and a rise in eco-conscious fashion startups
          are further driving the shift toward sustainability in the industry.
